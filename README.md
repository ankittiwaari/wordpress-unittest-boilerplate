# Wordpress unittest boilerplate
Sample boilerplate to begin with Wordpress + phpunit. This setup aims at writing test cases for wordpress plugins and themes. 

# Borrowed components
This setup uses few parts of <a href="https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/">Wordpress core development repository</a> 

# Initial setup
Please follow the steps listed at https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/ for initial set up.

# Directory structure
* `src` - place the files to be tested here
* `tests` - test cases to be placed here
* `reports` - this will contain the reports generated by phpunit
* `wp-test-lib` - files necessary to run WordPress functions.

# Installation 
* Clone the repo
* Add Database configuration in `wp-test-lib/wp-tests-config.php`, please use a separate DB to configure here.
* place you theme/plugin in src
* write the tests in `tests` folder
* run `phpunit`, this will run the test cases and place the clover formatted reports in `reports` folder. This report can further be used in <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/">Sonarqube</a> analysis to improve code coverage.
